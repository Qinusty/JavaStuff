# Graph Theory
This is a project I am working on in my spare time to learn graph theory.

## Intended features
1. Basic graph structure implementation
2. Primm's Algorithm for finding an MST
3. Kruskal's Algorithm for finding an MST
4. Dijkstra's Path Finding Algorithm
5. POSSIBLY: Visual representation of the Graph.
